    "1. Excites: The greatest challenges to education are disinterest and apathy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fish are kind of silly looking.\n",
    "TODO: Maybe move in that direction for the shape example or at least for the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cultivates curiosity: Questions and storytelling that cultivate natural curiosity are better than the threat of a test.\n",
    "\n",
    "No threats here.\n",
    "Incorporate a range of difficulty including some very beginner.\n",
    "Also, the interactive \"games\" have no time limit - this deemphasizes success vs failure, certainly in a test sense.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Is active: Effective learning is active, not passive. Watching a video is not enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fish graphs develop along with the story.\n",
    "Questions interspersed maintain engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive game is active.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Is applicable: Use it or lose it: it is essential to apply what you're learning as you learn it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drug example is very applicable.\n",
    "Making decisions (or even just understanding your doctor) in the face of statistics is a valuable skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is community driven: A community that challenges and inspires you is invaluable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not sure how to incorporate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Doesn't discriminate: Your age, country, and gender don't determine what you are capable of learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "I took care to choose examples that seemed accessible to a wide audience.\n",
    "Fish are innocuous.\n",
    "Simple shapes and colors are accessible across grades, languages, cultures.\n",
    "Simpson examples often include gender - something I avoided for this reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Allows for failure: The best learners allow themselves to make many mistakes along their journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Offer more opportunity for mistakes (that can be then fixed).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Sparks questions: The culmination of a great education isn't knowing all the answers — it's knowing what to ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: End with some good food for thought. Maybe one mathy one and one practical.\n"
