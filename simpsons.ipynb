    "Fish are kind of silly looking.\n",
    "TODO: Maybe move in that direction for the shape example or at least for the story.\n",

    "\n",
    "No threats here.\n",
    "Incorporate a range of difficulty including some very beginner.\n",
    "Also, the interactive \"games\" have no time limit - this deemphasizes success vs failure, certainly in a test sense.\n",

    "Fish graphs develop along with the story.\n",
    "Questions interspersed maintain engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive game is active.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Is applicable: Use it or lose it: it is essential to apply what you're learning as you learn it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drug example is very applicable.\n",
    "Making decisions (or even just understanding your doctor) in the face of statistics is a valuable skill.\n",

    "5. Is community driven: A community that challenges and inspires you is invaluable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not sure how to incorporate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Doesn't discriminate: Your age, country, and gender don't determine what you are capable of learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "I took care to choose examples that seemed accessible to a wide audience.\n",
    "Fish are innocuous.\n",
    "Simple shapes and colors are accessible across grades, languages, cultures.\n",

    "\n",
    "TODO: Offer more opportunity for mistakes (that can be then fixed).\n",

    "8. Sparks questions: The culmination of a great education isn't knowing all the answers — it's knowing what to ask.\n",
